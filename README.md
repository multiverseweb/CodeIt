## About
CodeIt is a software solution tool designed to streamline and enhance the coding experience for developers. It addresses several common challenges faced when working with coding platforms, such as LeetCode, and offers a range of features to improve code management, security, and performance analysis.

## Key Features

- Code Conversion and Integration:
> Efficient Code Conversion: Transforms default code templates provided by coding platforms into fully functional code. Developers can quickly adapt boilerplate code into their projects, allowing them to concentrate on algorithm development and testing.

- Code Obfuscation:
> Robust Security: Provides code obfuscation to safeguard against unauthorized access and reverse engineering. Ideal for developers needing to protect their intellectual property or work in secure environments.

- File Naming with Extensions:
> Organized File Management: Automates file naming and extension assignment, ensuring proper file organization and reducing errors in project management.
> 
>  `directoryName/questionNumber-question-title.extention`

- Time Complexity Analyzer:
> Performance Evaluation: Analyzes the time complexity of algorithms to help developers optimize performance and make informed decisions about algorithmic efficiency.

- User-Friendly Interface
> With a clean and straightforward UI, CodeIt ensures even beginners can navigate and utilize the tool effectively.

- Multi-Language Support
> Whether you‚Äôre coding in Python, Java, C++, or any other popular programming language, CodeIt has got you covered.
  
  Supported Features:
  | Language | Code Refinement | Code Obfuscation | Time Complexity Analyzer | Nomenclature |
  |-|-|-|-|-|
  | Python |‚úî|‚úî|‚úî|‚úî|
  | C++ |‚úî|‚úò|‚úî|‚úî|
  | Java |‚úî|‚úò|‚úî|‚úî|
  | JavaScript |‚úî|‚úî|‚úò|‚úî|
  | C |‚úî|‚úò|‚úî|‚úî|
  | SQL |-|‚úî|-|‚úî|

>[!NOTE]
> As of now, This tool generates code according to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) only. I'll be adding more coding platforms to it soon.
