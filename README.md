## About
CodeIt is a software solution tool designed to streamline and enhance the coding experience for developers. It addresses several common challenges faced when working with coding platforms, such as LeetCode, and offers a range of features to improve code management, security, and performance analysis.

Key Features
Code Conversion and Integration:

Efficient Code Conversion: Transforms default code templates provided by coding platforms into fully functional code. Developers can quickly adapt boilerplate code into their projects, allowing them to concentrate on algorithm development and testing.

Code Obfuscation:

Robust Security: Provides code obfuscation to safeguard against unauthorized access and reverse engineering. Ideal for developers needing to protect their intellectual property or work in secure environments.

File Naming with Extensions:

Organized File Management: Automates file naming and extension assignment, ensuring proper file organization and reducing errors in project management.

Time Complexity Analyzer:

Performance Evaluation: Analyzes the time complexity of algorithms to help developers optimize performance and make informed decisions about algorithmic efficiency.

User-Friendly Interface:

With a clean and straightforward UI, CodeIt ensures even beginners can navigate and utilize the tool effectively.

Multi-Language Support:

Whether you‚Äôre coding in Python, Java, C++, or any other popular programming language, CodeIt has got you covered.
